# Juan Antonio BreÃ±a Moral

## About

Since 1997, I have developed my career in Internet channel. In 2000, I failed an interview at TelefÃ³nica R&D due to giving a vague answer about [Java Applets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet), and that failure motivated me to deep dive into Java and feel interested in the Programming language. Over the following decades, I have contributed to the Java community in Robotics through projects like [LeJOS](https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), [LeJOS port for Debian](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java) and [OpenJDK build on ARM5](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/openjdk-ev3). In the last decade, I have been involved in various projects focusing on microservice architectures with Spring. A year ago, I started exploring [System prompts for Java](https://github.com/jabrena/cursor-rules-java) to help Java Software engineers in their daily work.
